# Cyclististic-BikeShare-Project

## Case Background
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company active in Chicago. As a junior data analyst, I have been tasked with understanding the difference between how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes. Casual riders are customers that purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members subscribe yearly for unlimited access to bikes. The marketing director believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of yearly memberships by converting casual riders into annual members. Pending executive approval, my team will be designing a new marketing strategy that pursues this idea.
Data analyzed is from April 2020 to March 2021.
